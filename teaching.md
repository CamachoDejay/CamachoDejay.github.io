## [](#header-1)Programming Sessions
* * *

The **Programming Sessions** are designed to teach computer programming and the MATLAB language to young researchers. The sessions focus on software construction, meaning mostly on coding and debugging but also keeping track of design techniques, construction planning, unit testing, and other activities. We will teach many different heuristic approaches to problem solving and introduce as fast as possible wicked problems by using projects that evolve as we solve them.

### [](#p1)Project 01

#### Project description

Now that we can handle basic input and output, it is time we start to do some interesting calculations and plotting. So, for our first project in the course (Project-01) we will work towards a graphical user interphase [(GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) that displays the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) (a very famous [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)) and allows the user to zoom into any area of the fractal with seemingly infinite resolution.
