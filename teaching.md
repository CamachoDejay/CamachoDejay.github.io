## [](#header-1)Programming Sessions
The **Programming Sessions** are designed to teach computer programming and the MATLAB language to young researchers. The sessions focus on software construction, meaning mostly on coding and debugging but also keeping track of design techniques, construction planning, unit testing, and other activities. We will teach many different heuristic approaches to problem solving and introduce as fast as possible wicked problems by using projects that evolve as we solve them.
