## Ongoing courses

Below you will find information and links related to ongoing courses.

## [](#header-1)Cellular Imaging - Course within the PhD education of The University of Gothenburg
The **Cellular Imaging** PhD course is designed as advanced introduction to Fluorescence and Electron microscopy for biology.
[Follow this link for detailed information about the course](/cellularimaging)

## [](#header-2)Programming Sessions
The **Programming Sessions** are designed to teach computer programming and the MATLAB language to young researchers. The sessions focus on software construction, meaning mostly on coding and debugging but also keeping track of design techniques, construction planning, unit testing, and other activities. We will teach many different heuristic approaches to problem solving and introduce as fast as possible wicked problems by using projects that evolve as we solve them.

## [](#header-3)Super resolution imaging
My colleagues at KU Leuven and I have recently published a Review entitled [An introduction to optical super-resolution microscopy for the adventurous biologist](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2050-6120/aaae0c/meta). I highly recommend this text to anyone interested in an introduction to optical microscopy, starting from the fundamental concepts governing compound and fluorescent confocal microscopy to the current state-of-the-art of super-resolution microscopy techniques and their applications.

The figure above (50 in the [Review](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2050-6120/aaae0c/meta)) presents the principle of SOFI and Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). (A) In SMLM, isolated fluorophores are localized, after which accumulated localizations are used to reconstruct a high-resolution image. (B) In SOFI, a larger fraction of fluorophores is in the 'on' state at any given time. (C) High resolution information is retrieved by analyzing spatial correlations in the intensity fluctuations for different locations across the field of view.
