# Rafael Camacho's personal site

I'm Rafael Camacho, a scientific officer in light and electron microscopy, interested in bioImage analysis, and software development. I did my PhD in the area of chemical physics, and you can find my CV in this site.

As a researcher I'm interested in the interplay between image analysis and automated mictoscopy to develop smart microscopy workflows. I also have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6CYGeeiNeaP81YAzfYWfta?si=0f4142c47fe942b2) where I discuss these topics and more.
