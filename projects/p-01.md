# Project-01 Mandelbrot set

## Project description

Now that we can handle basic input and output, it is time we start to do some interesting calculations and plotting. So, for our first project in the course (Project-01) we will work towards a graphical user interphase [(GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) that displays the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) (a very famous [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)) and allows the user to zoom into any area of the fractal with seemingly infinite resolution.

Topics:
1. Iterative calculations
2. Creating matlab figures (get/set attributes)
3. Creating matlab functions
4. Grpahical user interface - GUI
5. Object oriented Programming - OOP
6. Model-view-controller architecture for GUI

## Step 01

Most of you at this point are probably wondering what is the Mandelbrot set?

Link to information by Mathworks: [Mandelbrot.pdf](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/moler/exm/chapters/mandelbrot.pdf)

Well the set is a fractal which has a very simple and elegant equation. It is defined by the region in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane) consisting of the values z0 (initial point in the complex plane) for which the trajectories defined by the following equation:
```
z(k+1) = z(k)ˆ2+z0
```
remain bounded when k approximates infinity.

By bounded we mean that the calculated value of the trajectories (z) does not reach infinity as the iteration index (k+1) increases. Moreover, when we calculate the set numerically we do not have to wait until the z value overflows the capacity of floating point precision. A simple check of:
```
abs(z) >=2
```
will suffice as it can be proven that once z reaches a value of 2 or more it will become infinity afterwards.

However, at this point I’m expecting some of you to be discouraged due to the math. You might think this looks complicated. Well, let me show you an example so you see how simple it really is. Let’s take a point in the complex plane:
```
z0 = 0 + 1.24i;
```

0.	We initialize the trajectory value to 0.
```
z = 0;
```
This means that for a calculation depth of 0 (depth = k index) the point 0 + 1.24i still belong to the set.

1.	We do our first iteration by:
```
z = zˆ2 + z0;
```
now the value of abs(z) = 1.24

2.	 Let’s iterate one more time:
```
z = zˆ2 + z0;
```
now the value of abs(z) = 1.98

3.	let’s iterate one more time:
```
z = zˆ2 + z0;
```
now the value of abs(z) = 2.70; AHA!!!

This means that for an iteration depth of 3 we can show that the point 0 + 1.24 does not belong to the Mandelbrot set. On the table below a couple of examples:


|   Iteration    |   point 1   |   point 2    |  point 3     |
|   depth        |   0 + 2.1i  |   0 + 1.24i  |   0 + 0.9i   |
| :------------: |:-----------:|:------------:| :-----------:|
| 0              | 0.0         | 0.00         | 0.000        |
| 1  | **2.1 - DONE** | 1.24 | 0.900 |
| 2  | 5 | 1.98 | 1.211 |
| 3  | 22 | **2.7 - DONE** | 0.579 |
| 4  | 494 | 6.6| 1.110 |
| 5  | 2x10<sup>5</sup> | 45 | 1.103 |
| 6  | 5x10<sup>10</sup> | 2x10<sup>3</sup> | 1.097 |
| 7  | 4x10<sup>21</sup> | 4x10<sup>6</sup> | 1.893 |
| 8  | 1x10<sup>43</sup> | 2x10<sup>13</sup> | **4.22 - DONE** |

You can see from the table that different points in the complex plane will remain in the set for different iteration depths, some of them will always remain bounded.

Now that we know how to calculate if a point in the complex plane belongs or not to the set for a given depth calculation we can generate beautiful images. The way to do it is to calculate for a given subset of points in the complex plane if they belong or not to the set. As we want to eventually see a figure we cannot calculate until infinity, thus we only solve the equation for a given maximum iteration depth (let’s say 100). Then in a matrix you keep track of the iteration depth for which the point in the complex plane is still in the set. So now we have an index in the real axis, an index in the imaginary axis and a value for the iteration depth. By taking the later as an intensity value we can now plot an image:

## Asssigment 01

Having all this information in your hands I present to you the assignment of this week:

1. Take the code that you can find in following  [this **link**](https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/tree/master/Project-01/Step-01) and change it using what you have learned to ask the user for input when the program starts.
2. Try to understand the code! If you see any function which you do not recognize go to MATLAB’s documentation and see what it does.
3. As you can see I have hidden from you the way I calculate the depth values for the Mandelbrot set. Currently, this is done by the function mandelbrot.p. Your last task is to come up with your own way of calculating the mandelbrot depth value (your own implementation). For this last part feel free to make groups among you (max 4 students).
