# CV

## Summary
9+ years of research experience focusing on advanced microscopy methods and software development. I have been involved in highly interdisciplinary teams, and service provision within the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. I enjoy developing software for image processing, hardware control, and data analytics/visualization.
