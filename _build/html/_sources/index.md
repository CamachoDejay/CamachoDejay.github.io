I'm Rafael Camacho, a PhD in the area of chemical physics. Here you can have a look at my cv.

I am a scientific officer in light and electron microscopy, interested in bioImage analysis, and software development. I also have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6CYGeeiNeaP81YAzfYWfta?si=0f4142c47fe942b2) where I discuss these topics and more.

As a researcher I'm interested in the interplay between image analysis and automated mictoscopy to develop smart microscopy workflow. Here you can find a lis of my articles and current projects.
