# Rafael Camacho's personal site

I'm Rafael Camacho, a scientific officer in light and electron microscopy, interested in bioImage analysis, and software development. I did my PhD in the area of chemical physics, and you can find my CV in this site.

As a researcher I'm interested in the interplay between image analysis and automated mictoscopy to develop smart microscopy workflows. I also have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6CYGeeiNeaP81YAzfYWfta?si=0f4142c47fe942b2) where I discuss these topics and more.

I am pleased to announce that I have been selected by the SSF as one of the recipients of the Research Infrastructure Fellow: [Link to the SSF page in Swedish](https://strategiska.se/pressmeddelande/de-far-research-infrastructure-fellows/)

With this grant (15M SEK / 5 years) we will develop and offer [Smart Microacopy](https://www.gu.se/en/core-facilities/centre-for-cellular-imaging/smart-microscopy) workflows to our users at the [Centre for Cellular Imaging](https://www.gu.se/en/core-facilities/centre-for-cellular-imaging) of [Gothenburg University](https://www.gu.se/en)
