I'm a researcher working at the interception between chemistry, biology and physics. For the last 8+ years I have been involved in the development and implementation of advanced imaging and spectroscopy methods, using them to, for example, characterise materials with potential use in novel electronics, and to study biological relevant systems.

Currently I work in the unit of [Molecular Imaging and Photonics](https://www.chem.kuleuven.be/mip/index.htm) of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) ([Chemistry department](https://chem.kuleuven.be/en)). Below you will find a list of ongoing projects. For a full publication list please follow this [link](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=QRcaA74AAAAJ&hl=en).

**NEWS!** From the 1st of December I will be joining the [Centre for Cellular Imaging](https://cf.gu.se/english/centre-for-cellular-imaging) of the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/english). Having done my Ph.D. at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), this feels like coming back home after an exciting adventure. Looking forward to joining the CCI team!

## Bacterial survival and killing
[Link to the project's site.](/ProjectBacteria2018/)
Fluorescence microscopy allows researchers to observe dynamic processes in live-cells. Unfortunately, the size of bacterial cells (~2μm) is close to the resolving power of an optical microscope, known as the diffraction-limit. Therefore, while the general shape of bacteria can be seen, their sub-cellular details cannot be resolved. Particularly, observing the effects of antibiotic treatment on live bacteria is strongly obscured by the diffraction-limit.

Bacteria often live in hostile environments and have sophisticated cell envelopes that protect them and ensure their structural integrity. Many antibiotics kill bacteria (cell lysis) by targeting their cell envelope. Such is the case with beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin derivatives) which have been the most widely used antibiotics for over 50 years.

Recent advances have made it possible to overcome the diffraction-limit (Nobel prize in Chemistry 2014). However, this spatial super-resolution is accompanied by a loss in temporal resolution that hinders the use of these methods to study dynamic processes, such as cell lysis. Here we aim to overcome this problem and accomplish video-rate super-resolution imaging of bacteria during lysis. This data will be combined with rheological studies of model membranes to yield a physical model of the cell envelope during lysis. Such model is key for the development of new antibiotics, and holds promise to limit bacterial resistance, extending the lifespan of current antibiotics.

This project is developed in collaboration with the groups of [Prof. Jan Michiels](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/dtp/cmpg/spi/) (KU Leuven), [Prof. Jan Vermant](http://www.softmat.mat.ethz.ch/) (ETH Zürich) and [Prof. Theo Lasser](https://lob.epfl.ch/).

## Photoluminescence of organo metal halide perovskites (OMHPs) at micro and nano scale

We use fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution imaging and micro-spectroscopy to study luminescence quenching and enhancement of OMHPs due to charge trap dynamics and their photo-conversion.

This project is developed in collaboration with the group of [Prof. Ivan Scheblykin](http://www.chemphys.lu.se/research/groups/scheblykin-group/) ([Lund University](http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), [Division of Chemical Physics](http://www.chemphys.lu.se/)).

## Two-dimensional POLarization IMaging (2D POLIM)

2D-POLIM is a powerful polarization technique that
can be seen as an improvement of the fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence detected linear dichroism experiments. 2D-POLIM characterizes the correlation between the emission polarization of the sample and the electric field´s direction of the linearly polarized excitation light. The fluorescence intensity of the sample is measured as a function of the excitation and emission polarization analyser angles, &psi;<sub>ex</sub> and &psi;<sub>em</sub>, respectively. Using several different &psi;<sub>ex</sub>, &psi;<sub>em</sub> combinations a 2D polarization portrait is built. The polarization portrait´s data depends on the internal organisation of the multichromophoric-object, in terms of the orientation and number of chromophores, and the EET between them.

## Fluorocode and ADgut
In [FLUOROCODE](https://www.kuleuven.be/research/excellence/medical_technologies/hofkens.html) we develop technology that aims to complement the information derived from current DNA sequencing platforms. The technology developed by FLUOROCODE will enable DNA mapping at unprecedented speed and for a fraction of the cost of a typical DNA sequencing project. We aniticipate that our method will find applications in the rapid identification of pathogens and in producing genomic scaffolds to improve genome sequence assembly

[ADgut](http://adgut.eu/) - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the Western world. Until today, there is neither cure nor any preventive strategy on the horizon for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Recent results strongly support a microbial involvement in the development of AD and show how gut microbiome modulation can slow down or halt the onset of AD. This discovery represents a substantial paradigm shift for the etiology of AD. ADgut will therefore target the gut and its microbiota in view of a novel diagnosis. The gut modulation initiated by the encapsulated probiotics will cause a delay of AD-onset, i.e. prevention and pave the way to a novel therapy for Alheimer’s disease.
