## Basic concepts

A **program** is a computer readable what *to do* list.

**Programming** is the activity of writing and testing these programs.

To tell a computer what to do we need an appropriate language with special grammar and a standardized vocabulary – **programming language**. Eg. [MATLAB](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++.html), etc.

The software construction metaphor is very powerful and will be used throughout the sessions. The mental picture of **building software** is very useful as it hints at the importance of planning, experience, etc.

In **programming**, construction is mostly **coding** and **debugging** but also involves detailed **design**, **construction planning**, **unit testing**, integration, integration testing, and other activities.

From day one we want to highlight the importance of **Version control**: a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For a good introduction to Version Control Systems (**VCS**) we recommend the book [proGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Quickly **VCSs** have been around for a while and evolved trough:

1. Local VCS (E.g. [RCS](https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/), which is still in use today). Local and simple database that keeps all the changes to files under revision control.
2. Centralized VCS. To collaborate more efficiently centralized VCSs were developed, having a single server that contains all the versioned files, and several clients that check out files from that central place.
3. **Distributed VCS**. To solve one of the mayor problems of CVCs, Distributed Version Control Systems were developed. In such VCS (such as [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/), clients don’t just check out the latest version of the files: they fully hold the repository. This way, if any server breaks down, then any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.

To make life easier and if you are afraid of **command lines** on a **console/terminal** you can use [**Github**](https://github.com/) and [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/). Both of them have free user interfaces to help you with Git.

## MATLAB

Statement from the company:
"*MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. The , tools, and built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java*"

During this session we will have a look at a very basic program. It's purpose is to display the basics of MATLAB's integrated development environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)). We will learn basic ways in which MATLAB can report information back to the user. First we have a look at the ```disp``` function. Then we quickly introduce some string formatting via the ```sprintf``` function and show how we can print formatted strings to a text file via the ```fprintf``` function.

Now lest have a look at the code of this session which you can find [**here**](https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/tree/master/Session-01)

## Assignment


The task for this session is to use the information contained in the example code to generate a main script that will:
1. Save into a variable the name of the student
2. Save into a variable the age of the student
3. Print to a text file called 'output.txt' the following output:
```
Hello, my name is <student's name>
And I'm <student's age> years old.
```

Note that the output consists of two distinct lines. Also please pay attention to the formatting of the number, to say that you are 23.00 years old makes little sense.
