During the first session we created a basic program that wrote some information to the screen or text file. In other words it can create an **output**. However, useful programs generally produce results based on some **input** given to them.

During this session we introduce some of the most basic and important data classes of MATLAB: the numeric array and the cell array. We will handle the change of a string into a number, in relation to user **input**. We will do a small introduction to the ```assert()``` function, which we can use to check if a program is working as intended. Further we will have a quick look to basic control flow - ```for```-loop.

## Basic concepts
Together, **input** and **output** are known as **I/O**.

In many instances we will encourage the user to enter an **input** (take an action) we call this a **prompt**.

Now, once we have received an input from the user we will need a place in the computer's memory to place/store it:

*"An __object__ is a region of memory with a __type__ that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it. A named object is called a __variable__.”* [Stroustrup – Programming... (2nd edition)](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)

A **statement** that introduces a new **variable** is called a **definition**.

The **type** of a **variable** defines what kind of information can be placed into the **object**. Moreover, It also defines which **operations** can be applied to the **variable** and what they mean. On the table below we show some examples from MATLAB

| Operation      | double      | char         | string       |
| :------------: |:-----------:|:------------:| :-----------:|
| assignment     | ```=```     | ```=```      | ```=```      |
| addition    | ```+```| ```+``` *Casts to double| ```+``` *Casts to double|
| concatenation   | ```cat()```, ```[]```|```cat()```, ```[]```|```cat()```, ```[]```|
| greater than| ```>```|```>```|```>```* dimensions must agree|

## MATLAB - how to prompt the user
We will first concentrate in receiving data from the user via the keyboard. Later on we will explore other ways a program can receive **input**. The functions we will explore today are:
1. ```input()```
2. ```inputdlg()```

For examples on how to use them look at the [code of this session](https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/blob/master/Session-02/main.m) and for more information type ```doc input``` or ```doc inputdlg``` in MATLAB's command window.

## Assertion - why is it inportant
The following is an extract from wikipedia:
_"Programmers can use assertions to help specify programs and to reason about **program correctness**. For example, a **precondition** —an assertion placed at the beginning of a section of code— determines the set of states under which the programmer expects the code to execute. A **postcondition** —placed at the end—describes the expected state at the end of execution."_

## Flow control - ```for```-loop

In the [next session]() we will give a better introduction to control flow. For the moment it suffice to say that some times we want to repeat a group of statements several times. This is generally called **iteration**. In MATLAB a basic ```for```-loop that displays on the command window the numbers 1, 2, ..., 10 looks like:

```
for i = 1:10;
  disp(num2str(i));
end
```
Now lets have a look at the [code](https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/blob/master/Session-02/main.m) we have prepared for this session.

## Assignment

Based on the [code](https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/blob/master/Session-02/main.m) of this session, create a program that gathers a list of 10 Names, Sex, Ages. The program must print that information into a text file called output.txt where the first line indicates the name of the variables. Once all data has been printed you will add 2 extra lines that say:
1. the mean age of the people in this data set is: _mean of all ages_
2. there are _number_ women and _number_ men in the data set.

On our next session we will review other functions used for controlling the flow of a program. However, if you feel adventurous you can try to add some special cases to this program. To get some inspiration type ```doc control flow``` on the command window. You can try to, for example:

1. Make the syntax correct. If there are no women or men it is better to say so in text instead of printing a 0.

2. What if the user decides to input less than 10 names, can you do something so the program does not break but prints the output nevertheless after giving a warning to the user indicating that he did not place the 10 values as expected. Check ```doc error
handling``` for inspiration.

3. Finally if you an do the above points then you can also probably change the program in such a way that the number of people in the data set is not decided before hand. You just keep asking for data until the user decides it is enough. For this you will need ***concatenation***
