During this session, we will concentrate on data fitting using one of the minimization algorithms of MATLAB. The function we will work with is called fminsearch, and allows you to find the minimum of an unconstrained multivariable function. We will present an example of its use to fit a sine wave. We will then see some of the problems related to minimization algorithms, the presence of deep local minima where the algorithm gets stuck and cannot get out, thus, never reaching the global minima. After looking at the example we will work together so you fit a Gaussian to a dummy data set.

Now what does minimization has to do with fitting. Well this comes from the idea of mathematical optimization, where we try to find the best set of values from a large group, based on a specific criterion. In our case the optimization criterion will be the minimization of a function’s value. Imagine that you have an experimental data, a trace over time for simplicity, to which you want to fit a model. One way to do this is to: 1- generate a model trace based on some input, 2- find the difference between the model and the experimental data, 3- then iteratively change the inputs for the model and calculate the difference again, is it better/worse? We keep doing this iterative model’s input change in a smart way so we minimize the difference between model and experimental data.

# Minimisation algorithms in MATLAB

MATLAB has several minimization functions available, a nice guide can be found [here]( https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/optimizing-nonlinear-functions.html). During this session we will use ``fminsearch``, which can handle the minimization of a function that depends on many variables. ``fminsearch`` will try to return a vector x that is a local minimizer of the mathematical function in question near the starting vector $$x_0$$.

During the minimization process of ``fminsearch`` the variables of the function to minimize are not constrained. Therefore, if we know beforehand that certain variables must be within some set limits (e.g $$0<x<1$$) then other minimization functions might be more appropriate (see ``fminbnd``).

``fminsearch`` uses the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm as described in Lagarias et al (SIAM Journal of Optimization. Vol. 9, Number 1, 1998, pp. 112–147.). While you do not need to understand the details of this algorithm to be able to use it, you should know that the algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to a local minimum, and as we will see in the [code example]https://github.com/CamachoDejay/ProgrammingSessions/tree/master/Session-05, in many cases the solutions we obtain depend on the initial guess used. Therefore, minimization algorithms such as ``fminsearch`` must be used with care. We should do our best to decrease the number of variables that ``fminsearch`` has to keep track of, and we must find a good starting point (educated guess) for the minimization.

# Assignment
The task for this session is to do your own fitting for a Gaussian model:

1. Generate a list of uniformly distributed random numbers - ``randn`` Let’s say 1000 numbers.

2. Generate a distribution out of the list/vector of numbers and store the distribution for further fitting - ``histcounts``

3. Fit the distribution using a Gaussian model and fminsearch. For this you will have to come up with a function to minimize in analogy to the example presented in the session’s code. A Gaussian function is defined as:

$$
f_{(x|\mu,\sigma^2)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\Bigg[{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\Bigg]
$$
