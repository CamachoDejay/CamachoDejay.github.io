During this session, we will concentrate on solving a system of linear equations

$$
A*x = y
$$

using the ```mldivide()``` function . We will use it to do some very basic spectral unmixing. Basically, we will decompose a mixed fluorescence spectra (containing 2 known species) into its constituent spectra, and find the relative ratio between the species.

# Solving a system of linear equations in MATLAB

MATLAB has many tools to help you solve a system of linear equations: [see this link](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/systems-of-linear-equations.html). During this session we will concentrate on the function ```mldivide()```. In particular we will see how to handle the case when $$A$$ is a rectangular m-by-n matrix with m not equal to n, and $$y$$ is a matrix with m rows, then ```mldivide(A,y)``` returns a least-squares solution to the system of equations:
$$
A*x = y
$$

## Mix of 2 fluorescence spectra
Let us consider the case of two species, A and B, that are able to fluoresce and have distinct emission spectra: $$S_A$$ and $$S_B$$ . If we were to measure a mix of these two species then we would obtain a total spectra $$S_{tot}$$ which is:

$$
S_{tot} = c_1 S_A + c_2 S_B
$$

Therefore we can use ```mldivide()``` to find $$c_1$$ and $$c_2$$ given a measured spectra $$S_{tot}$$ . We just have to understand that:
1. $$S_{tot}$$ corresponds to our $$y$$ vector with dimensions m-by-1.
2. Matrix A can be built by placing $$S_a$$ and $$S_b$$ as its columns, to obtain a m-by-2 matrix.

Therefore, we just have to do:
```
C = mldivide(A,y)
```
to obtain a 2-by-1 vector C that contains the coefficients $$c_1$$ and $$c_2$$.
