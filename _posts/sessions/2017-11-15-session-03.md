After the first two sessions we start to have a feeling as to how we can get a program to take some user input, do some calculations based on that input to generate output and finally communicate that output back to the user. On the third session we will concentrate a bit more into the basics of **computation**. We will learn how to generate more complicated *expressions*, how to make our program to choose among different alternatives (**selection**), and how to repeat a **computation** many times (**iteration**). Finally we will learn how to keep code clean, reusable and maintainable by separating a particular sub-computation into a **function**.


# Basic concepts
Now lest try to define/expand some key concepts.

In a broad sense, **computation** refers to the act of producing some outputs based on some inputs.

[*Control flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) refers to the order in which instructions are executed in a program. Among the different control flow statements we have:
1. [if](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/if.html)
2. [switch](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/switch.html)
3. [while](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/while.html)
4. [for](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html)

We will go into some details of these statements below.

Now if we want to solve a very complex problem our main tool in programming is to break such a problem into many little ones that are easier to handle. This is where the idea of **abstraction** becomes important: hide details that we don't need to see in a convenient container, e.g. a **function**.  

A **function** is nothing more that a named sequence of statements. Commonly functions return a result - output or return value. Also, in the context of computations functions receive inputs that will affect the calculated output.

# Flow control in MATLAB
Now lets consider the different statements [MATLAB has available to control the flow of a program](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/control-flow.html). During this session, we will concentrate on **Selection** and **Iteration** statements.

## Selection
One of the most basic decisions a program has to do is to select among alternatives. For example, if the signal-to-noise-ratio of the input signal is very low should we even try to calculate something?
MATLAB, as most programming languages, has two statements that can be used for selection: ```if``` and ```switch```.

### if-statement
An ```if``` statement will execute a block of code if a condition is true. This is the most basic form of selection. In MATLAB the syntax looks like:

```
if expression
  statements
elseif expression
  statements
else
  statements
end
```
Notice that MATLAB includes the syntax ```elseif```. This basically means that we can evaluate if a second selection rule (condition) is valid or not. However, be aware! it is your responsibility to ensure no overlap between the different conditions. This is important because once the program enters into one of the if cases and evaluates the associated statements it will go out of the if block. See for example:
```
a = 1;
if a < 5
    disp('Smaller than 5!')
elseif a < 2
    disp('Smaller than 2!')
else
    disp('Larger than 5!')
end
```
The output of this code will only be:
```
Smaller than 5!
```

### switch statement
A ```switch``` statement is designed for a very specific and common type of comparison, checking if a value is equal to a constant. In MATLAB the syntax looks like:

```
switch switch_expression
  case case_expression
    statements
  case case_expression
    statements
  ...
  otherwise
    statements
```

MATLAB has the option to switch over, numerical values using ```==```, character vectors (strings) using ```strcmp()```, objects and cell arrays. The later two we will cover in another session. Below you find a simple numeric example that will see if the user wins a price or not:

```
n = input('Enter a integer between 0-9: ');
n = uint16(n);
switch n
  case {2, 3}
    disp('You almost won! Good luck next time!')
  case 4
    disp('You won! AWESOME!')
  case {5,6}
    disp('You almost won! Good luck next time!')
  otherwise
    disp('Not even close! Good luck next time')
end
```

## Iteration
Another very common thing that can happen when doing a computation is to repeat something several times. This repetition of the same block of statements (typically over a series of elements in a data structure, e.g. elements of a vector) is called **iteration**.

### while statement
A ```while``` loop will repeat the evaluation of some statement(s) as long as a condition is true. In MATLAB the syntax looks like:
```
while expression
  statements
end
```
Below we present a basic example where we want to compute how many times we have to consecutively square a value to overflow the computer's capacity to keep track of the numeric value:
```
n = input('Enter a number: ');
val = n;
go = isfinite(val);
counter = 0;
while go
    counter = counter + 1;
    val = val^2;
    go = isfinite(val);
end
fprintf('We had to consecutively square the value %4.2f %d times to overflow the computer \n', n, counter)
```

Now, one of the most important considerations when programming with while loops is to ensure that we do not generate by mistake an [infinite loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop). See my code above, is it safe to use? what if the user inputs 1, 0, or 0.5?

### for statement
On the other hand, iterating over a list of number is so common that most programming languages have a special syntax for it. A for statement is very similar to a while statement except that this time we define how many times we want to iterate before hand. In MATLAB the syntax looks like:
```
for index = values
  statements
end
```
A classical example that iterates over a vector and does some calculation (in this case squares) is as follows:
```
x = -10:1:10;
y = zeros(size(x));
for idx = 1:length(x)
    i_val = x(idx);
    y(idx) = i_val^2;
end
figure(1)
plot(x,y)
xlabel('x values')
ylabel('y values')
title('y = square(x)')
```
another alternative is:
```
x = -10:1:10;
y = zeros(size(x));
idx = 1;
for i_val = x
    y(idx) = i_val^2;
    idx = idx + 1;
end
figure(1)
plot(x,y)
xlabel('x values')
ylabel('y values')
title('y = square(x)')
```

## Functions
By now, you probably have a good idea as to what a **function** is: You have been using many of the built in functions of MATLAB. However, why should you learn to create functions of your own?

### Why do we want to use functions
Functions are very useful when we want to:
1. Divide the logic of a program into clear separate sub-calculations.
2. Makes reading the program a lot easier.
3. Makes it possible to re-use the function in different places of the same program or even move a functionality to another project.
4. Helps us in testing the program.

We will go into more details about what makes a function good/bad later on.

### Function types in MATLAB and how to create them
Now lets have a quick look at the types of functions you can create in MATLAB and how to use them. MATLAB makes a clear difference between a **script** and a **function** file (see [link from Mathworks](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/scripts-and-functions.html)). While both scripts and functions allow you to re-use code, a function file is able to receive input and return output in a more controllable way.

If you wish to create a new function file the easiest way is to go into MATLAB and click on New > Function. This will generate an untitled file that contains:
```
function [outputArg1,outputArg2] = untitled2(inputArg1,inputArg2)
%UNTITLED2 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
outputArg1 = inputArg1;
outputArg2 = inputArg2;
end
```
By modifying this template we can create our own functions. See below an example of a function used to obtain the mean value of all elements in a vector. Be careful to name the function file correctly, both the name of the file and the name of the function in the function definition (``` function [out] = functionName(in)```) must be the same. See below an example of a function file called 'my_mean.m':

```
function [out_val] = my_mean(vec)
%my_mean calculates the mean of all values in a vector.
%   We will explain this later

% check for precontidions
assert(isvector(vec),'input must be a vector')
% do calculations
sum_val = sum(vec);
n_elements = length(vec);
out_val = sum_val/n_elements;

end
```
Finally we can call this function from our script by, for example:
```
a = rand(100,1);
my_val = my_mean(a);
MATLAB_val = mean(a);
assert(my_val == MATLAB_val, 'Houston, we have a problem')
```
MATLAB has different kind of functions and we will go over them later on, however if you are already interested have a look [here](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/types-of-functions.html), and below we present a list of the different functions MALTAB handles.

1. Local functions
2. Nested functions
3. Private functions
4. Anonymous functions


# Assignment
The task for this session is to go back to [Project01-Step01](/Project01-Step01) and:

1. Come up with a while and for loop implementation that calculates the Mandelbrot set. Basically we will solve together the last assignment of the first step of the project.

2. Save both implementations into a function file. Use a switch statement to let the user choose which implementation he wants to use, the for or while loop.

3. As an extra bonus look into the tic/toc functions of MATLAB, what do they do? use them to see which implementation is the fastest.
