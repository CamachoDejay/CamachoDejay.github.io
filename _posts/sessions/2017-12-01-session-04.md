During this session, we will concentrate on how to make MATLAB code easier to read and faster via vectorization. MATLAB has many built in function that are able to operate over all elements in an array, e.g. for multiplication the vectorised version is ```.*```. I will present an easy example and then go back into our Mandelbrot project to show you how to solve it using first nested loops and then via a more vectorised version of the code that allows me to remove the nested loops. While on this particular case the speed difference is not very large it makes the code much easier to understand.
