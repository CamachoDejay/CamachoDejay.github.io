Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I have been following the [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) made by Jonathan McGlone.
