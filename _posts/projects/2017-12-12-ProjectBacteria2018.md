## Project description

Fluorescence microscopy allows researchers to observe dynamic processes in live-cells. Unfortunately, the size of bacterial cells (~2μm) is close to the resolving power of an optical microscope, known as the diffraction-limit. Therefore, while the general shape of bacteria can be seen, their sub-cellular details cannot be resolved. Particularly, observing the effects of antibiotic treatment on live bacteria is strongly obscured by the diffraction-limit.

Bacteria often live in hostile environments and have sophisticated cell envelopes that protect them and ensure their structural integrity. Many antibiotics kill bacteria (cell lysis) by targeting their cell envelope. Such is the case with beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin derivatives) which have been the most widely used antibiotics for over 50 years.

Recent advances have made it possible to overcome the diffraction-limit (Nobel prize in Chemistry 2014). However, this spatial super-resolution is accompanied by a loss in temporal resolution that hinders the use of these methods to study dynamic processes, such as cell lysis. Here we aim to overcome this problem and accomplish video-rate super-resolution imaging of bacteria during lysis. This data will be combined with rheological studies of model membranes to yield a physical model of the cell envelope during lysis. Such model is key for the development of new antibiotics, and holds promise to limit bacterial resistance, extending the lifespan of current antibiotics.

This project is developed in collaboration with the groups of [Prof. Jan Michiels](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/dtp/cmpg/spi/) (KU Leuven), [Prof. Jan Vermant](http://www.softmat.mat.ethz.ch/) (ETH Zürich) and [Prof. Theo Lasser](https://lob.epfl.ch/).
